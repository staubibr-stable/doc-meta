The number of emergencies is proportional to the population count of the area and uses a random factor for variance. Emergencies are sent to the first closest hospital by driving distance. Hospitals have a capacity and a number of active cases. If a hospital is over capacity, the emergency is rejected and returned to the geographic area. The area then sends it to the second hospital, then third hospital to be procesed. If the emergencies are rejected by all 3 hospitals, they are counted as casualties.",
